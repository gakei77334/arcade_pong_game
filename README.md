# Classic Pong Arcade Game using Turtle

This Python script implements the classic Pong arcade game using the Turtle graphics module. Players can control paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen, earning points when the opponent misses the ball.

**Key Features:**
* Two-player mode with controls for both right and left paddles.
* Paddles respond to keyboard inputs ('Up' and 'Down' for the right paddle, 'W' and 'S' for the left paddle).
* Ball movement with collision detection against walls and paddles, bouncing off accordingly.
* Scoreboard tracks points for each player and updates when a player misses the ball.
* Game ends when one player reaches a set score limit or can be restarted.

**Technologies Used:**
* Python
